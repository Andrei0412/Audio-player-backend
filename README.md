## Project description

* For this project I have implemented an application similar in functionality to Spotify, simulating different actions made by users. These actions will be simulated using some commands received in the input files. Thus, the perspective from which I control the application is that of an admin, who perceives all the actions performed by the users and can generate different reports related to all the users.
